LARK TENETS
===========

## I. Lark Targets Rigorous Programming

Lark allows you to write correct programs.
Many diverse features support correctness.
Given the choice between convenience and rigor, we choose rigor.

## II. Lark Avoids Overabstraction

Lark runs on real computing hardware with specific capabilities.
We expose these capabilities to allow high-performance programs.
We avoid language-level abstractions without performant implementations.

## III. Code Expresses Execution

We avoid features requiring knowledge of the language implementation.
We avoid coercions, implicit function calls, and invisible dispatch.
Translations should predictably impact performance.

## IV. Libraries Inhabit A Level Playing Field

No library will be privileged by inclusion within the languge itself.
Libraries inhabit a uniform global namespace.
